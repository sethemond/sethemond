## Projects

### [Filament Spool Scale](https://github.com/sethemond/filament-spool-scale)

3D-printed filament spool holder with an integrated load cell for real-time filament weight monitoring. Designed to sit on top of an IKEA LACK Ender 3 enclosure and connected to OctoPrint for live weight monitoring and smooth payout of filament.
